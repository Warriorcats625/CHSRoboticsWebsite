        <div>
            <h1 class="mini-title">Who are we?</h1>
            <p>The Centennial High school FTC Robotics team, "Robot in Pieces" is aimed to train students on FTC and give the valuable experience of working with a team. Our members are passionate about robotics, computer science, engineering, and/or marketing. </p>
            <h1 class="mini-title">What do we do?</h1>
            <p>Our team's goal is to expand students' knowledge of STEM, learn to work together with a team, and gain skills they can use in a professional environment. To accomplish this we use the First Tech Challenge competition. We build a robot to compete in the challenge and aim to win. There are many different parts to this. Obviously building the robot and programming but also, marketing and outreach, designers, making sure we're organized, etc. Each part requires a specific set of skills. Here in the club we help teach these skills and guide you in the right direction to use them in the real word.</p>
            <h1 class="mini-title">Why do we participate in FTC?</h1>
            <p>FTC is a great learning experience for students of all ages. It teaches things like Gracious Professionalism™, good sportsmanship, and workplace skills. FTC is a way for our team to teach STEM related things and help guide students in the right direction towards their profession while at the same time having fun. While FTC does come with some challenges, it is important we teach new comers how to face them in a professional and efficient manner. FTC provides students to learn and grow from their experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"Everyone starts somewhere, no one learns something knowing everything. Throughout our competition and experience we've learned a great deal. We've learned from our mistakes, accidents, and failures, but we've kept on going and hope to others continue on the same path."</p>
